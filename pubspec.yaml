# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.

      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/iran_sans.ttf
  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/car_door_lock.mp3
    - assets/img/bg/
    - assets/images/
    - assets/trunk_close.mp3
    - assets/door_open.mp3
    - assets/car_door_close.mp3
    - assets/car_door_open.mp3
    - assets/start_engine.mp3
    - assets/start_power.mp3
    - assets/open_trunk.mp3
    - assets/lock.mp3
    - assets/off.mp3
    - assets/test.geojson
    - assets/countries.geojson




  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
  #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
